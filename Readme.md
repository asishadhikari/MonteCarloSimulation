# RANDOM WALK PROGRAM
 	Creating a random walk program that tries to minimise the amount of money a user spends on Lyft. Doing in python

## Problem statement:
	Using Monte Carlo simulation technique, perform a random walk simulation experiment to find the longest random walk you can take so that on average you will end up 4 blocks or fewer than home (in a city arragned in a grid)
	
## Assumptions:
   1. User only wants to look at walks that are less than 6 blocks
   1. Each lyft ride takes about $10
   1. Find out on average what is the most amount of blocks with the least amount of money

## To Dos:
	- [ ] Implement in python 
	- [ ] Implement in C++
